# DeadSimpleRtsPrototype
A quick-n-dirty RTS prototype of a game idea I had without base building or multiple of the same unit.

This idea could be expanded into a true RTS in the future. It kind of stretches the definition right now.

### How to Play
- Kill the enemies before they attack your houses.
- You must kill enemies with your matching-color unit (e.g. your green guy kills only green enemies)
- Big enemies require two of your guys at the same time to kill (the colors must match).

### Controls
- Left click to attack/move
- You can hold the number keys 1, 2, and 3 to include units in the attack/move order
- For example, hold 1 and click in order to move guy 1
- Or, hold 1 and 3 and click in order to move guys 1 and 3 at the same time

### Losing
- You lose if three enemies reach any of your houses.
- It gets more difficult over time >:)
